Welcome to EddieHub! an Open Source community aimed at encouraging and promoting communication, best practices and technical expertise in an inclusive and welcoming environment.
Eddie has always believed in giving back to the tech community with particular focus on creating and supporting opportunities for those wanting to start a career in tech, through diversity and inclusion programmes. This started out by mentoring and delivering workshops in association with tech for good charities, to creating and building the EddieHub Community. This organisation is the home of open source! Make Pull Requests, open Issues, share ideas, help each other, fix problems! This is a place welcome to all! üéâ

<b>How do I join EddieHub?</b> <br>
EddieHub has many community and cross community platforms, events and calls. It is best to sign up to the [Newsletter](http://eddiejaoude.io/newsletters) and join [Discord](http://discord.eddiehub.org/) to start collaborating with the inclusive EddieHub community. More information can be found in blog post on [getting started](https://www.eddiejaoude.io/blog-may-2021-joining-eddiehub).

<b>Can I find a mentor in EddieHub?</b> <br>
At EddieHub we believe that everyone is a mentor and can help others in the community. This community approach is beneficial for the mentee as they are exposed to various perspectives, and for the mentor they develop many of their communication and collaboration skills. Even if you are one month into your journey, there is someone who is one day in and who can benefit from your experience and insight.

<b>How can I get my Open Source / Resume / GitHub Profile reviewed on a live stream?</b> <br>
Eddie does regular reviews on live streams. To add your project / profile / resume for review please raise an [issue on our support repo on GitHub](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/support/issues/new/choose).

<b>Why does EddieBot complain about my Discord messages?</b> <br>
At EddieHub we are passionate about moving away from gender favouring, polarising, race related, religion inconsiderate or other unequal phrasing. Therefore if you use terms such as ‚ÄúHi Guys‚Äù, then EddieBot responds with a notification highlighting that this is not inclusive language and will suggest alternatives.

<b>I just joined, why can't I post links on Discord?</b> <br>
You have recently joined the community and you have tried to share a link, but found that NightBot has deleted this message. We appreciate that the community is a place to share your work, which we encourage only for our regular community members (aka ‚ÄúTeam Eddie‚Äù). To become a regular and get the role "Team Eddie", we highly suggest to get involved in the community conversation and add value by helping other community members.
